House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned travels to a distant land, where he meets a slew of foes, but in the end,
triumphs over them all. Ned lives happily ever after, grows old and lives to
see his children's children.
